/*
 * File: check_elfp_main.c
 *
 * Description:
 *
 * 1. Tests the elfp_main implementation.
 *
 * 2. Go to ELF-Parser/src and run "$ make examples". Check the examples/build   
 *      directory.
 *
 * 3. How do you verify the output?
 * 	a. The file size can be obtained with "ls -l". That file size
 * 	and the one this program shows should be the same.
 *
 * 	b. You should see that the path is same.
 *
 * 	c. Go to /proc/PID/. Checkout the "fd" directory.
 * 		* Make sure the file descriptor displayed by this
 * 		program points to the file you passed to this program.
 *
 * 	d. Go to /proc/PID/maps. Make sure there is a "r--p" mapping
 * 	which matches your file.
 *
 * XXX: I am assuming that the free_vector member is functioning properly.
 * 	You can checkout check_free_list.c example for that.
 *
 * 	* Not bothering about the handle now.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * $ ELF-Parser/examples$ gcc check_elfp_main.c ../src/elfp_int.c -o check_elfp_main
 * $ ELF-Parser/examples$ ./check_elfp_main ./check_elfp_main
 * fd = 3
 * Path = ./check_elfp_main
 * File size = 18064
 * Start address = 0x7fa383554000
 * PID = 8912
 *
 * a. File size: Note that they match.
 * ELF-Parser/examples$ ls -l check_elfp_main
 * -rwxr-xr-x 1 dell dell 18064 Dec  6 01:07 check_elfp_main
 *
 * b. Path is the same
 *
 * c. Go to /proc/8912 directory.
 *
 * i. Go to /proc/8912/fd and checkout descriptor 3.
 * /proc/8912/fd$ ls -l 3
 * lr-x------ 1 dell dell 64 Dec  6 01:11 3 -> /home/dell/Documents/projects/write-your-own-XXXX/ELF-Parser/examples/check_elfp_main
 *
 * ii. Checkout /proc/8912/maps file. The following mapping is the output of our mmap().
 * 7fa383554000-7fa383559000 r--p 00000000 08:05 7211572 			/home/dell/Documents/projects/write-your-own-XXXX/ELF-Parser/examples/check_elfp_main
 * 
 *
 * 4. Making sure there are no memory leaks.
 * 	* Comment the while(1); loop, 
 *	* Comment the elfp_main_vec_inform() line of code in elfp_main_fini().
 *	* And then recompile the program and run it again.
 *
 * * I ran it for a bunch of different ELF files. There were no memory leaks.
 *
 * 	* Don't forget to uncomment elfp_main_vec_inform()!
 *
 * The above helps you test the happy path. If you want to take a look
 * at the error handling, give wierd inputs.
 *
 * $ ./check_elfp_main does_not_exist.txt
 * $ ./check_elfp_main check_elfp_main.c
 *
 * and more!
